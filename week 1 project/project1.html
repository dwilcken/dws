    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The <strong><abbr title="Great Highland Bagpipes">GHB</abbr></strong>  are a type 
    of bagpipe native to Scotland. It has achieved widespread recognition through its 
    usage in the British military and in pipe bands throughout the world. The bagpipe is 
    first attested in Scotland around 1400 AD,[citation needed] having previously appeared 
    in European artwork in Spain in the 13th century. The earliest references to bagpipes 
    in Scotland are in a military context, and it is in that context that the Great 
    Highland bagpipe became established in the British military and achieved the 
    widespread prominence it enjoys today, whereas other bagpipe traditions throughout 
    Europe, ranging from Portugal to Russia, almost universally went into decline by the 
    late 19th and early 20th century. Though widely famous for its role in military and 
    civilian pipe bands, the Great Highland bagpipe is also used for a solo virtuosic 
    style called piobaireachd, or simply <em>pibroch</em>.</p>    

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p><em>Ancient Origins</em></p>
    <p>Though popular belief sets varying dates for the introduction of bagpipes to 
    Scotland, concrete evidence is limited until approximately the 15th century. The Clan 
    Menzies still owns a remnant of a set of bagpipes said to have been carried at the 
    Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, though the veracity of this claim is debated.[1] There 
    are many ancient legends and stories about bagpipes which were passed down through 
    minstrels and oral tradition, whose origins are now lost. However, textual evidence 
    for Scottish bagpipes is more definite in 1396, when records of the Battle of the 
    North Inch of Perth reference "warpipes" being carried into battle.[2] These 
    references may be considered evidence as to the existence of particularly Scottish 
    bagpipes, but evidence of a form peculiar to the Highlands appears in a poem written 
    in 1598 (and later published in The Complaint of Scotland which refers to several 
    types of pipe, including the Highland: "On hieland pipes, Scotte and Hybernicke / Let 
    heir be shraichs of deadlie clarions."[3]</p>
